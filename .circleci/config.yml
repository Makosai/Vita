# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/
orbs:

# Define a job to be invoked later in a workflow.

  # Below is the definition of your job to build and test your app, you can rename and customize it as you want.
